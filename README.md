# Programming a Redback Line Tracking Bot

## Description
This repository contains the code for a line tracking bot named "Redback." The bot is designed to follow a line on the ground using infrared sensors, making it ideal for various robotics projects and competitions.

## Features
- **Line Tracking**: The bot can detect a line and follow it using two infrared sensors.
- **Directional Control**: The bot can move forward, backward, left, right, or stop based on sensor input.
- **Speed Control**: Adjusts motor speed based on the sensor readings for smoother navigation.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Hardware Requirements**:
   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
   - DC motors and motor driver (e.g., L298N)
   - Infrared sensors
   - Chassis for the bot

2. **Software Requirements**:
   - Arduino IDE
   - Basic knowledge of programming in C++

3. **Instructions**:
   - Connect the motors and sensors to the appropriate pins as defined in the code.
   - Open the Arduino IDE, copy the code into a new sketch, and upload it to your Arduino board.
   - Ensure the bot is placed on a surface with a clearly defined line for tracking.
